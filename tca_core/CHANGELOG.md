## 0.0.1

First release of the Composable Architecture port for Dart! This version includes the core concepts from the original library: Store, Reducer, Effect, State, and Actions. Additionally, it provides several operators for reducer composition, enabling simple apps to be built using the available tools.

Testing is a key focus of this release, offering exhaustive state testing and action verification, making it one of the most comprehensive testing solutions compared to other Dart/Flutter state management approaches.

Finally, this version introduces a preliminary v0 implementation of the Shared type, which allows different features to share pieces of state without requiring complex synchronization logicâ€”while maintaining full testing capabilities.

## 0.0.2

Adds support to optional state, allowing reducers to run and local stores to be viewed only when their associated state is available.

## 0.0.3

Update code formatting and add example.md.

## 0.0.4

Adds navigation support and examples with [NavigationDestination] widget and [Presents]/[Presentable] types in the core library.

## 0.0.5

Fix: remove automatic [Store] state clean up on [NavigationDestination] and associated types (Disposable).

## 0.0.6

Feat: make use of Presents reference semantics to implement automatic [Store] state clean up on [NavigationDestination], propagating the change up in the store tree.

## 0.1.0

Breaking: create [Reducer] mixin and [Feature] type. Feature implementations must provide a `build` method, bringing the domain and business logic implementation closer to the Widgets api. Reducer operators such as `pullback`, `ifLet` and `combine` are now Reducer implementations such as `Scope`, `IfLet` and `Reduce.combine`. See [tca_flutter_example](https://github.com/viniciusaro/dart-composable-architecture/tree/main/tca_flutter_example/lib) for concrete implementations.

## 0.1.1

Feat: add onChange reducer
Chore: more organized unit tests for stores, effects and reducers
Chore: more documentation comments
