Port of [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) (TCA, for short) for the [Dart Language](https://dart.dev) and [Flutter Framework](https://flutter.dev).

# Basic Usage

This library enables the use of [The Composable Architecture](https://pub.dev/packages/composable_architecture) with Flutter. The main type it introduces is WithViewStore, a widget that handles store emissions and triggers an update callback, allowing you to create custom widgets of any type for your features.
